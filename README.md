𝗕𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱:  
Patient experience and operational efficiency are crucial in healthcare. In this project, I analyzed key metrics such as patient demographics, wait times, and satisfaction scores to uncover valuable insights for improving patient care.  

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜 𝗳𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗼𝗻: 
✅ Total number of patients and their demographics  
✅ Average wait times and their correlation with patient volume  
✅ Patient satisfaction trends across different months  
✅ Key insights based on age, gender, and race distribution  

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀:  
🔹 Total Patients: 73 | Avg. Patient Satisfaction Score: 4.2  
🔹 Majority of patients fall in the 31-50 age group.  
🔹 55% of patients are female, while 45% are male.  
🔹 Wait times tend to increase as patient volume rises, showing a direct correlation.  
🔹 Patient satisfaction scores fluctuate, with January having the highest (6.4) and June the lowest (4.1).

𝗠𝘆 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀: 
🔹 Reducing wait times can potentially boost patient satisfaction.  
🔹 Monitoring patient trends across demographics helps optimize healthcare resources.  
🔹 Hospitals should focus on peak patient hours to improve efficiency and reduce bottlenecks.
